# How Distriba Works

This document explains the Distriba protocol from a user’s point of view,
step by step, without assumptions about prior crypto knowledge.

Distriba is a rule-based system. Outcomes depend on time, market conditions,
and user choices.

---

## Step 1 — Activating a License (“Miner”)

To participate, a user activates a Distriba license by paying a one-time
activation fee in USDC.

- Each license is time-limited (e.g. 180 days)
- Each license has a **finite earning capacity**
- A license does NOT guarantee profit or returns

The activation fee is routed into the protocol and helps build permanent
liquidity.

---

## Step 2 — Earning Entitlement Over Time

Once active, a license begins accruing **entitlement**.

Entitlement represents the right to receive Distriba tokens (DSRX) under
protocol rules.

Important properties of entitlement:
- It accrues gradually over time
- It cannot exceed the license’s lifetime cap
- It has no direct dollar value on its own

Entitlement only becomes tokens when the user chooses to claim it.

---

## Step 3 — Claiming Entitlement Into Vesting

At any time, a user may convert accrued entitlement into a vesting position.

When claiming, the user chooses a vesting option:

- **Default vesting (recommended)**  
  Tokens unlock gradually with no penalty.

- **Accelerated vesting**  
  Tokens unlock faster but with a reduction in total tokens received.

Shorter vesting periods reduce the total amount of DSRX the user receives.
The fastest option carries the highest penalty.

These penalties exist to discourage short-term extraction.

---

## Step 4 — Vesting Period

After claiming, tokens are held in a vesting position.

During vesting:
- Tokens unlock gradually over time
- Unlocked tokens can be withdrawn at any time
- Locked tokens cannot be transferred or sold

Longer vesting aligns users with the long-term health of the protocol.

---

## Step 5 — Withdrawing DSRX

As vesting progresses, unlocked DSRX can be withdrawn.

When withdrawing:
- Only unlocked tokens are released
- Withdrawals do not affect locked positions
- No guarantee exists regarding token price

DSRX is a freely traded token. Its market value may be higher or lower than
when the user joined.

---

## Step 6 — Converting DSRX (Optional)

Users may choose to convert DSRX into other assets using external markets
or the protocol’s gateway.

When converting:
- Market price applies
- Liquidity depth affects slippage
- Exit fees may apply

Exit-related fees are routed into protocol liquidity, not to founders.

---

## What Happens to Fees and Penalties

All protocol fees and vesting penalties are recycled into liquidity:

- Fees are paired with DSRX and USDC
- Liquidity positions are created
- Liquidity is permanently locked

No individual — including founders — can withdraw this liquidity.

This design strengthens the system as usage increases.

---

## What Limits Risk to the System

Distriba includes several protective rules:

- Finite earning caps per license
- Time-based vesting
- Penalties for early extraction
- Limits on instant unlocks
- Permanently locked liquidity

These rules prevent common failure modes such as infinite farming,
sudden liquidity removal, or runaway emissions.

---

## What Users Should Understand

Distriba does not promise:
- A fixed return
- A guaranteed outcome
- A stable token price

Users may experience:
- Gains
- Break-even outcomes
- Losses

All outcomes depend on market conditions and personal choices.

---

## Summary

In simple terms:

- You activate a license
- You earn entitlement over time
- You choose how and when to vest
- Patience is rewarded
- Impatience is allowed, but paid for
- The system grows stronger through use

Distriba is designed for transparency and durability, not guarantees.
