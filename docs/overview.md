# Distriba Protocol — Overview

Distriba is a protocol for fair, time-based token distribution with permanently locked liquidity.

It is designed to reward participation over time while preventing common failure modes such as
unlimited emissions, liquidity withdrawal, and short-term extraction.

Distriba does not promise returns.
It enforces transparent, immutable rules for how tokens are earned and released.

---

## What Distriba Is

Distriba allows participants to activate a time-limited license (“miner”) that accrues
token entitlement over a fixed period.

Participants may convert earned entitlement into the Distriba token (DSRX) over time,
subject to vesting schedules, acceleration penalties, and protocol-defined limits.

The protocol routes all fees and penalties into permanently locked liquidity,
aligning long-term incentives between users and the system.

## What You Get When You Join

When you activate a Distriba license:

- You gain access to a **finite earning capacity** (token entitlement)
- Entitlement accrues over time while your license is active
- Earned entitlement can be claimed into vesting positions
- Vesting positions unlock gradually or faster with penalties

The protocol limits **how many tokens you can earn**, not what they will be worth.

---

## What Determines Value

The value of Distriba tokens (DSRX) is determined by:

- Market demand
- Liquidity depth
- User behavior (vesting vs early unlocks)
- Overall protocol usage

DSRX is a freely traded token. Its price can go up or down.

Distriba does not peg, stabilize, or guarantee token value.

---

## Caps and Fairness

Each license has a **maximum lifetime earning capacity**.

This cap exists to:
- Prevent infinite farming
- Ensure fair distribution
- Protect liquidity from over-extraction

The cap limits **token quantity**, not dollar value.

Depending on market conditions, participants may realize:
- More than their activation cost
- Approximately their activation cost
- Less than their activation cost

All outcomes are possible and depend on external market conditions and user choices.

---

## Vesting and Acceleration

By default, earned tokens vest gradually over time.

Participants may choose faster access to tokens, but doing so incurs penalties:
- Shorter vesting periods reduce total tokens received
- Instant access carries the highest penalty

Penalties are not burned or extracted by founders.
They are routed back into the protocol as liquidity.

Patience is rewarded. Impatience is allowed, but paid for.

---

## Liquidity and Fees

Distriba routes protocol fees into liquidity that is:

- Added automatically
- Represented as Uniswap v3 LP NFTs
- Permanently locked with no withdrawal mechanism

Founders cannot remove liquidity.
There is no treasury-controlled price support.
The protocol does not defend or manage market price.

---

## What Distriba Is NOT

Distriba is not:

- A guaranteed return product
- A savings account
- A bond or yield instrument
- A treasury buyback system
- A promise of profit

It is a rule-based distribution protocol.

---

## Why the Rules Are Fixed

Distriba’s core rules are designed to be:
- Predictable
- Transparent
- Resistant to manipulation

Key parameters are either immutable or governed through time delays,
ensuring no sudden changes can harm participants.

This rigidity is intentional and protects all users equally.

---

## Summary

Distriba offers:
- Finite, time-based token distribution
- Permanent liquidity alignment
- Clear incentives for long-term behavior
- No promises, only rules

Participants should join only if they understand the risks
and believe in the long-term usefulness of the system.
