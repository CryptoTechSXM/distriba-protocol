# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

This FAQ addresses common questions about the Distriba protocol in clear,
non-technical language.

---

## What is Distriba?

Distriba is a protocol for time-based token distribution with permanently locked
liquidity.

It allows participants to activate a license that accrues token entitlement over
time under fixed, transparent rules.

---

## Is Distriba an investment?

No.

Distriba does not promise returns, profits, or appreciation.
It is a rule-based distribution system for a market-priced token.

Participants should not treat Distriba as an investment product.

---

## What do I get when I pay the activation fee?

You receive access to a **time-limited license** that:
- Accrues token entitlement over time
- Has a finite lifetime earning capacity
- Is governed by vesting and unlock rules

You are not purchasing tokens directly.

---

## What does the “cap” mean?

The cap limits **how many tokens** a license can earn over its lifetime.

It does **not** limit or guarantee the dollar value of those tokens.

Depending on market conditions, the value of earned tokens may be higher,
lower, or approximately equal to the activation fee.

---

## Can I lose money?

Yes.

Token prices can fall, liquidity can be limited, and early unlocking reduces
the number of tokens received.

Distriba does not guarantee break-even or profit.

---

## Can I earn more than the activation fee?

Yes, it is possible.

If the token price increases after you earn tokens, the realized value may
exceed the activation cost.

This is not guaranteed and depends entirely on market conditions.

---

## How do vesting penalties work?

If you choose faster access to tokens:
- You receive fewer total tokens
- The difference is routed back into protocol liquidity

Penalties are not taken by founders or developers.

---

## Where do fees go?

All protocol fees and penalties are routed into liquidity.

Liquidity is:
- Added automatically
- Represented by Uniswap v3 LP NFTs
- Permanently locked with no withdrawal mechanism

---

## Can founders remove liquidity?

No.

Liquidity is permanently locked and cannot be withdrawn by founders,
developers, or any individual.

---

## Can the rules change?

Core protocol rules are either immutable or governed through time delays.

This prevents sudden or arbitrary changes that could harm participants.

---

## Is there a maximum supply of tokens?

Token supply is constrained indirectly through:
- Finite earning caps per license
- Time-based accrual
- Vesting mechanics

There is no unlimited minting.

---

## What happens if everyone exits at once?

The protocol includes protections such as:
- Vesting delays
- Unlock penalties
- Limits on instant unlocking
- Exit fees routed to liquidity

These mechanisms reduce the impact of coordinated exits.

---

## Is this a Ponzi scheme?

No.

Distriba does not:
- Pay old users with new users’ funds
- Promise fixed returns
- Require continuous inflows to function

The protocol continues to operate regardless of user growth rate.

---

## What happens if the protocol fails or has a bug?

Distriba is software and carries smart contract risk.

Bugs, failures, or unexpected behavior are possible.
There are no guarantees, refunds, or recovery mechanisms.

Participants interact with the protocol at their own risk.

---

## Who controls Distriba?

Distriba operates through smart contracts.

There is no central operator controlling outcomes.
Certain parameters may be governed through time-locked mechanisms.

---

## Should I participate?

You should only participate if:
- You understand the risks
- You accept potential loss
- You believe in the long-term usefulness of the system

Distriba is designed for transparency, not guarantees.
