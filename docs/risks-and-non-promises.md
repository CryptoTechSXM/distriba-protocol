# Risks & Non-Promises

This document describes the risks associated with participating in the Distriba
protocol and clarifies what Distriba does not promise or guarantee.

All participants are responsible for understanding these risks before activating
a license or interacting with the protocol.

---

## No Promised Returns

Distriba does not promise:
- Profit
- Returns
- Yield
- Break-even outcomes
- Appreciation of any token

Distriba enforces rules for token distribution.
Token value is determined entirely by market conditions.

Any references to caps, limits, or earning capacity relate to **token quantity**,
not dollar value.

---

## Market Risk

Distriba tokens (DSRX) are freely traded.

As with any market-priced asset:
- Prices may rise
- Prices may fall
- Prices may remain stagnant

Participants may receive tokens worth more than, equal to, or less than the
activation cost.

Distriba does not intervene in markets or defend token price.

---

## Liquidity Risk

Although Distriba builds and locks liquidity:
- Liquidity depth may be limited
- Large trades may incur slippage
- Exit timing affects realized value

Liquidity being locked does not imply price stability or exit guarantees.

---

## Vesting and Timing Risk

Tokens earned through Distriba vest over time.

Choosing faster access to tokens:
- Reduces the total amount of tokens received
- May result in lower realized value

Impatience is permitted, but it carries explicit penalties.

---

## Protocol Rules Are Enforced Automatically

Distriba operates through immutable or time-locked smart contracts.

This means:
- Rules cannot be changed arbitrarily
- Mistakes cannot be reversed
- There is no discretion or exception handling

Participants should not assume human intervention in exceptional situations.

---

## Smart Contract Risk

Distriba relies on smart contracts.

Despite careful design and testing:
- Bugs may exist
- Unexpected behavior may occur
- Loss of funds is possible

Participants interact with the protocol at their own risk.

---

## No Custodial Relationship

Distriba does not custody user funds on their behalf.

Users retain control of their wallets and interactions.
Distriba does not offer account recovery, refunds, or reversals.

---

## No Fiduciary Duty

Distriba developers, contributors, and maintainers:
- Do not act as fiduciaries
- Do not manage funds for users
- Do not provide investment advice

Participation is voluntary and self-directed.

---

## No Guaranteed Access to Future Versions

Participation in Distriba v0 does not guarantee:
- Access to future protocol versions
- Preferential treatment
- Migration rights

Future versions, if any, may differ materially or not exist at all.

---

## Regulatory Uncertainty

The regulatory treatment of tokens and protocols varies by jurisdiction
and may change over time.

Participants are responsible for understanding and complying with
applicable laws and regulations.

---

## Summary

Distriba is a transparent, rule-based protocol.

It provides:
- Defined mechanisms
- Fixed constraints
- No promises

Participants should only engage if they:
- Understand the risks
- Accept potential loss
- Believe in the long-term usefulness of the system
